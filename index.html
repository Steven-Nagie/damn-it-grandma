            <h3>A Note On Bias</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-0">
              Bias appears everywhere; it is inherently human to process new information through past experience to help interpret it.
              It's also a fact of life that the truth is often difficult to find, whether due to purposeful obfuscation or the chaotic nature of the universe.
              The best tools we have to understand the world around us are, after all, just observation.
              The best science of the 17th century said that mercury could probably turn lead into gold, but Isaac Newton died very poor, with outrageous amounts of deadly lead in his system.
              However, science, economics, and society at large are systems in progress. They are constantly evolving yada yada yada

            There are a couple common misconceptions about the economy that can lead people to bad conclusions.

            <br>
            <br>

            First, the stock market is not the economy. The major measurements of the stock market that are always bandied about are usually the Dow and NASDEQ, right?
            Well, both of these are simply indices (or averaged measurements) on a group of stocks. In the case of the NASDEQ, it follows almost all of the stocks listed on the NASDEQ stock exchange.
            In the case of the Dow, it measures just 30 large companies. So this raises the obvious question: Can we really say the economy is healthy just because the stock of 30 large companies is doing well?
            <br>
            <br>

            Surely that depends on who you are. If you're a major stockholder in those companies, then you might feel like it is. But the vast majority of people don't have money invested in the stock market.
            Instead, we could look at the real buying power of the average family. Since 2001, the median household income for renters rose 0.5%, while rent prices rose 13%.
            At the same time, US wealth has become increasingly monopolized by a smaller and smaller percentage of people.

            </a>
            will show you, the top 1% of people now have more wealth than than the entire middle class here in America, and that gap is always increasing.
            Since 1995, the share of wealth held by the lower and middle income groups have decreased while the rich have gotten richer.

            Americans already pay 4 times more per person for healthcare. And that's for a medical system that lags well behind the rest of the developed world in patient outcomes.
            Our rate of infant mortality, death in childbirth, and death due to lack of care is many times higher than the rest of the developed world.

            <br>

            A great deal of that goes to pharmaceutical and insurance companies - third parties whose only vested interest is in keeping their stock prices high and their costs low.
            Their bottom line costs you money but never lends anything to your health.
